Super smoothies that brighten up your day!


Flavours:

Beautiful Berries, Perfect Pink, 

Selling at:
Lewes Highstreet,

When:


We are raising money for different charities and also using the money for the ingredients in the smoothie. Delicious flavours come out at different times in the year! If we are not there selling the smoothies, please email us; the address will be at the bottom. We will email the reason why we are not at the stall. Please accept us not being there.

There are six different people running this and all of them are wonderful smoothie makers! If you want to make a website like this, I reccomend using Github which is what I use. 

At the stall, we will be doing a game. The game is "Smoothie taste!". We will give you a selection of smoothies and you will have to guess the flavour. We will let you have a look of the ingredients and the names before you start.


The smoothies have only juices and fruits in them so you don't have to worry about allergies. If you do have any allergies to fruits, please contact us at the stall.
